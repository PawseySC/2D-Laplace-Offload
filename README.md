# 2D-Laplace-Offload

The main purpose of this tutorial is to present similarities and differences between device offload mechanisms available in OpenACC and OpenMP standards. It uses a basic serial implementation of a 2D Laplace equation solver (written in C programming language). OpenACC and OpenMP versions of the code are given together with build instructions for [Topaz cluster](https://support.pawsey.org.au/documentation/display/US/HPC+Systems#HPCSystems-Topaz).
